### Fixed Bugs

#### Widescreen Whitespace
 - On larger screens the right side of the page had a horizontal slider that created unwanted whitespace.
 - Tried fixing by standardizing usage of 100% instead of 100vw in css, did not solve issue but helped in guide.html by making the gray background not be wider than wanted.
 - Finally fixed issue using overflow-x: hidden; in body in CSS which solved the issue.

#### Sideways Screens
 - On mobile the webpage suffered sizing related issues when a smaler screen turned sideways.
